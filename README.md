Pandas and Matplotlib

This code reads a CSV file containing data on food waste per capita, selects the relevant columns, and renames them for a better understanding. It then sorts the data by the amount of food waste per capita and creates a pivot table to select the countries of interest. Finally, it creates a bar chart of the selected countries' food waste per capita in 2019 and saves it as a PNG file.

To run this code, you need to have the pandas and matplotlib libraries installed in your Python environment. The input file "food_waste.csv" should be in the same directory as the script. The output file "Food_waste_2019.png" will also be saved in the same directory.

The bar chart shows the amount of food waste per capita in kilograms for the selected countries in 2019. The y-axis represents the amount of food waste in kilograms per capita, and the x-axis represents the countries.

Note that the code selects only a limited amount of countries, and you can modify the script to include or exclude more countries as you decide. Just make sure that the column names and the format of the input file remain the same.
